Goomba Lab
==========

_Goomba Lab_, an HTML5 game prototype originally written for the Global Game Jam 2013 at MIT in Cambridge, MA, USA from January 25th through January 27th, 2013.

_Goomba Lab_ is designed to helps middle school students learn basic scientific inquiry and critical thinking skills by helping goombas get through mazes. Each goomba has different traits that players must deduce in order to solve the puzzles.
