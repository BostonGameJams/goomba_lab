Each goomba has different traits that players must deduce in order to solve the puzzles.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Educational features\r\n\r\n- The puzzles are often open-ended, encouraging students to explore and construct their own learning experience\r\n\r\n- In order to solve the puzzles, students follow the steps of the scientific method:\r\n - Observation: Through the “goomba cam,” students can observe goomba behavior without interfering\r\n - Hypothesis: By noticing patterns in goomba behavior, students form testable hypotheses.\r\n - Experiment: Students place elements into the environment and see if the goombas react in expected ways\r\n - Results: An experiment that confirms a student’s hypothesis will lead to a win!\r\n\r\n- Goomba Labs is aligned with Next Generation Crosscutting Concepts and Science Practices, including:\r\n - Observed Patterns\r\n - Cause and Effect\r\n - Asking Questions and Defining Problems\r\n - Constructing Explanations and Designing Solutions\r\n- Using the on-screen level editor, students take on the role of designer, learning systems thinking. Levels are created using symbolic notation, and the “level code” can be easily shared with friends and classmates via text message or twitter.\r\n\r\nLINK TO TEACHER GUIDE\r\n\r\n### Credits\r\n\r\n##### Designers\r\n- Marli\r\n- Jessica\r\n- Deidre \r\n\r\n##### Developers\r\n- Andrew\r\n- Greg\r\n- Darren \r\n\r\n##### Art\r\n- Creath\r\n\r\n##### Sound and Music\r\n- Rick\r\n\r\n### Other info\r\nMoar info!\r\n\r\nCopyright info!","google":""}
