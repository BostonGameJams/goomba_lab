Each goomba has different traits that players must deduce in order to solve the puzzles.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Educational features\r\n\r\n- The puzzles are often open-ended, encouraging students to explore and construct their own learning experience\r\n\r\n- In order to solve the puzzles, students follow the steps of the scientific method:\r\n - Observation: Through the “goomba cam,” students can observe goomba behavior without interfering\r\n - Hypothesis: By noticing patterns in goomba behavior, students form testable hypotheses.\r\n - Experiment: Students place elements into the environment and see if the goombas react in expected ways\r\n - Results: An experiment that confirms a student’s hypothesis will lead to a win!\r\n\r\n- Goomba Labs is aligned with Next Generation Crosscutting Concepts and Science Practices, including:\r\n - Observed Patterns\r\n - Cause and Effect\r\n - Asking Questions and Defining Problems\r\n - Constructing Explanations and Designing Solutions\r\n- Using the on-screen level editor, students take on the role of designer, learning systems thinking. Levels are created using symbolic notation, and the “level code” can be easily shared with friends and classmates via text message or twitter.\r\n\r\n[Download the Teacher Guide](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/13736220/Goomba%20Curriculum.pdf)\r\n\r\n### Video Demo\r\n![Screenshot](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/13736220/Goomba%20screenshot.png)\r\n[Play Video Demo](http://www.screenr.com/tJ07)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Credits\r\n\r\n##### Designers\r\n- Marli Mesibov\r\n- Jessica Polka\r\n- Deidre Witan\r\n\r\n##### Developers\r\n- Andrew Brockert\r\n- Greg Kinneman\r\n- Darren Torpey\r\n\r\n##### Art\r\n- Creath Carter\r\n\r\n##### Sound and Music\r\n- Rick Cody\r\n\r\n##### Educational Content\r\n- Deidre Witan\r\n\r\n##### Producer\r\n- Marli Mesibov\r\n\r\n##### Special Thanks to:\r\n- Ryan Kahn\r\n- Rik Eberhardt\r\n- Global Game Jam\r\n- MIT Game Lab\r\n- Learning Games Network\r\n- Our fantastic playtesters!\r\n\r\n\r\nContent on this site is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License.","note":"Don't delete this file!
